# Introduction

Visual Studio Code has become the go-to editor for millions of developers worldwide. Its extensive customization options and powerful features can significantly boost your productivityâ€”if you know how to use them effectively.

In this post, I'll share 10 essential VS Code tips that have transformed my development workflow.

## 1. Multi-Cursor Editing

One of VS Code's most powerful features is multi-cursor editing. Press `Cmd+D` (Mac) or `Ctrl+D` (Windows/Linux) to select the next occurrence of the current word. Keep pressing to select more instances, then edit them all simultaneously.

```javascript
// Before: Need to rename all instances of 'userName'
const userName = "John";
console.log(userName);
alert(userName);

// Use Cmd+D to select all instances and rename together
const userProfile = "John";
console.log(userProfile);
alert(userProfile);
```

## 2. Command Palette

Access the command palette with `Cmd+Shift+P` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux). This is your gateway to every VS Code command, setting, and extension action.

Some frequently used commands:
- `Format Document` - Auto-format your code
- `Change Language Mode` - Switch syntax highlighting
- `Toggle Terminal` - Show/hide integrated terminal

## 3. Zen Mode

Eliminate distractions with Zen Mode (`Cmd+K Z` on Mac, `Ctrl+K Z` on Windows/Linux). This hides all UI elements except your code editor, helping you focus on what matters.

## 4. IntelliSense and Auto-Import

VS Code's IntelliSense provides smart completions based on variable types, function definitions, and imported modules. Even better, it can automatically add import statements when you use a type or function.

```typescript
// Start typing a component name
// VS Code will suggest it and auto-import
import { Button } from '@/components/ui/button';

function MyComponent() {
  return <Button>Click me</Button>;
}
```

## 5. Integrated Terminal

Stop switching between windows. Use `` Ctrl+` `` to toggle the integrated terminal. You can even split terminals or create multiple terminal instances for different tasks.

```bash
# Terminal 1: Running dev server
npm run dev

# Terminal 2: Running tests
npm test

# Terminal 3: Git operations
git status
```

## 6. Snippets and Emmet

Create custom code snippets for frequently used patterns. VS Code also includes Emmet built-in for rapid HTML/CSS writing:

```html
<!-- Type this in an HTML file -->
div.container>ul.list>li.item*3

<!-- Press Tab to expand into: -->
<div class="container">
  <ul class="list">
    <li class="item"></li>
    <li class="item"></li>
    <li class="item"></li>
  </ul>
</div>
```

## 7. Git Integration

VS Code has excellent Git integration built-in. View changes, stage files, commit, and even resolve merge conflictsâ€”all without leaving the editor.

Key shortcuts:
- `Cmd+Shift+G` - Open Source Control panel
- `Cmd+Enter` - Commit staged changes
- Click the branch name in the status bar to switch branches

## 8. Breadcrumbs Navigation

Enable breadcrumbs to see your current file's location and quickly navigate through symbols. Toggle with `View > Show Breadcrumbs` or use `Cmd+Shift+.` to focus on breadcrumbs.

## 9. Settings Sync

Sync your VS Code settings, extensions, and keyboard shortcuts across multiple machines using Settings Sync. Enable it via the gear icon > Turn on Settings Sync.

This is invaluable when working on multiple computers or setting up a new development machine.

## 10. Extension Recommendations

Install these essential extensions:
- **Prettier** - Code formatter
- **ESLint** - JavaScript linter
- **GitLens** - Supercharged Git integration
- **Auto Rename Tag** - Automatically rename paired HTML/XML tags
- **Path Intellisense** - Autocomplete filenames
- **Thunder Client** - REST API testing (lightweight Postman alternative)

## Bonus: Custom Keybindings

Don't like the default shortcuts? Customize them! Open `Preferences: Open Keyboard Shortcuts` and create your own workflow.

My custom keybindings:
```json
{
  "key": "cmd+shift+f",
  "command": "editor.action.formatDocument"
},
{
  "key": "cmd+shift+t",
  "command": "workbench.action.terminal.new"
}
```

## Conclusion

These tips have saved me countless hours over the years. VS Code is incredibly powerful, and the more you invest in learning its features, the more productive you'll become.
